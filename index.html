    <h1>Recipes!</h1>

    <p>This is the second time I am going through The Odin Project. This will be a recipe site that utilises HTML and
        CSS.</p>
    <p>Other programming languages may also be used, however currently I don't plan on it.</p>
    <p><strong>These are just 2 lists that have been written in basic HTML, the first is an unordered list and the
            second is an ordered list. Currently not relevant.</strong></p>
