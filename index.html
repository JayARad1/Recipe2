    <h1>Recipes!</h1>

   <p>This is the second time I am going through The Odin Project. This will be a recipe site that utilises HTML and
        CSS.</p>
    <p>Other programming languages may also be used, however currently I don't plan on it.</p>
    <p><strong>As much as I don't like using AI to learn because you're essentially getting someone else
        to do the work for you, I have utilised ChatGPT to write some CSS. I have always struggled with CSS so using AI
        I have achieved some aethistic upgrades to which I will try to learn from just from messing around with the CSS 
        styles.
