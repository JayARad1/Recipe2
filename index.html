    <p>This is the second time I am going through The Odin Project. This will be a recipe site that utilises HTML and
        CSS.</p>
    <p>Other programming languages may also be used, however currently I don't plan on it.</p>
    <p><strong>As much as I don't want to use AI to create some aspects of this website, I have been struggling with
            CSS.
            I have used chatGPT to write a little bit of CSS, I give chatGPT a prompt and take the code it gives me, and
            then I edit
            the code it has given me to change things to the way I want it. It has worked well so far and I feel I am
            starting to
            understand CSS a little better.
